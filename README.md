# implantable_dataloger
This design is based on the STM32L452RE micro-controller, aiming to design a implantable monitor to collect small animalâ€™s certain creature signal, including ECG, acceleration, body temperature.  For the L4 series micro-controller, the HAL library offers the basic application level API for programming and STM32CubeMX is also used to perform the initial configuration of peripherals. Also ,this design introduces the accelerometer ADXL362 and how to communicate with it via SPI interface. The micro SD card is used as major data storage device. The data will be output in the from of txt file, therefore the migration of fat file system will also be implemented.
